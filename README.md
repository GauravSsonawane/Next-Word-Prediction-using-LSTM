## End to End ML project
I developed a project called 'Next Word Prediction using LSTM,' which leverages deep learning for natural language processing. Using Shakespeare's Hamlet as the dataset, I tokenized the text, created n-gram sequences, and padded them to train an LSTM-based sequential model. The model includes an Embedding layer for word vectorization, two LSTM layers to capture context and sequential dependencies, and a Dense layer with softmax activation for predicting the next word. I deployed the model as a Streamlit application, allowing users to input text and get real-time predictions. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in NLP, sequence modeling, and deploying machine learning models in an interactive application, while also exploring techniques to handle challenges like padding and overfitting.
